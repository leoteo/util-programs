Design principles - File formats

   Working with the most recent software for atomistic simulations requires a
   lot of conversion between different file formats.
   
   As two formats never store exactly the same information, creating a single 
   "unified" data structure for a collection of similar formats is impossible -
   as soon as a new format turns up, the "unified" data structure would have to
   be adjusted and potentially all code making use of it.

   For this reason, formats are handled as classes of their own and conversions
   to other formats are added to these classes as needed.
   Only fundamental concepts that are independent of a format are represented in
   data structures (and may be used in the format implementations).

Design principles - Algorithms for n dimensions
   
   It is assumed that the number of dimensions is known at compile time.
   Template based methods may thus be used instead of resorting to recursion.
   Where the number of dimensions is fixed a priori, a specialized
   implementation will also do.

Design principles - Miscellaneous
   
   - The class interface should not depend on external libraries explicitly
     in order to make it possible to move to another library.
     This may require some code duplication ...

    - boost
