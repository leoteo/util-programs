- combine extrapolate and sumbias to a single program
  => extrapolated cubes never have to be written to disk
- program robertos make_STM in C++

- cube.cpp: reduce compile time by 
  - importing less qi spirit headers? done
  - importing less qi phoenix headers? done
  - doing easier rules

- global: Change to classes instead of structs as soon as possible

- la: replace Grid by template<unsigned int dim> Grid and implement
  stride/resize using Blitz++
  One might think of a specialization CubeGrid and move the convenience
  functions there  (declared in formats/cube.h)
- Sadly, there is no const way of mapping preexisting data with blitz (?)
  Think about a solution for that
