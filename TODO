- cube.cpp: make sumXY independente of input. maybe return vector.

- extrapolate: Check that levels are appropriately shifted
- combine extrapolate and sumbias to a single program
  => extrapolated cubes never have to be written to disk
- program robertos make_STM in C++

- cube.cpp: reduce compile time by 
  - importing less qi spirit headers? done
  - importing less qi phoenix headers? done
  - doing easier rules

- global: Change to classes instead of structs as soon as possible
