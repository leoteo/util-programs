- cube.cpp: passing stream by reference and then resizing produces
  bogus results. need to check that

- cube.cpp: writing cube file takes a very long time. Not the writeStream method
  itself, but the construction of the stream (writing to disk: 1.8s out of 34s
  for complete writing process)

- cube.cpp: make sumXY independente of input. maybe return vector.

- extrapolate: Check that levels are appropriately shifted

- cube.cpp: reduce compile time by 
  - importing less qi spirit headers? done
  - importing less qi phoenix headers? done
  - doing easier rules

- check effect of -O2 or -O3

- global: Change to classes instead of structs as soon as possible
